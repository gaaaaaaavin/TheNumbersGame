# TheNumbersGame
a mini guessing game i made in python where a user picks a
number between 1 and 20 and based on yes and no inputs by
the user and if functions, the script bring up the number
the user is thinking. added a few funny responses to keep
things interesting while creating this script that you'll
enjoy too.
dived a bit into "def", "if", "elif", "else". i'm really
proud of "def inputAnswer(x)" on line 17. i've managed to
simplify user inputs to True and False statements while
keeping in mind errors while typing out "YES", "yeS", 
"yAs", "y", "ys" etc. to "True". the only issue i had was
if the user accidentally hit enter when a True or False
input was required.
